# ur3_ik_trajectory
Simulation of a UR3 robot arm in MATLAB/Simulink using inverse kinematics and trapezoidal trajectory planning.This project demonstrates a vision-guided simulation of a 6-DOF UR3 robot arm in MATLAB/Simulink. The robotâ€™s end-effector is commanded to reach a target (cube) position detected from a simulated vision input. A trapezoidal velocity profile generator provides smooth Cartesian trajectories, which are solved through inverse kinematics to obtain joint configurations. The simulation is visualized in MATLAB using a rigidBodyTree model, highlighting the integration of trajectory planning, kinematic control, and robotics visualization.
